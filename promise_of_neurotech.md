# (WIP) The Promise of Neurotechnology

## 1. The Digital Prison of Our Own Making

Despite being a computer scientist and machine learning engineer, I often joke with friends that I hate computers. This is obviously not entirely true—after all, I've spent the last decade studying computer science and building software. But all good jokes contain truth, and there is certainly an element of truth here. I simply hate wasting time browsing the internet on my phone. And yet I feel powerless to stop it.

We are living in an age of unprecedented digital manipulation. Our minds are being shaped by black-box, algorithmically generated feeds of text, images, and videos, designed not to inform or enrich but to maximize engagement and sell advertisements. Each swipe brings a hit of novelty and excitement, each interaction a dose of dopamine, carefully engineered to keep us scrolling. These systems induce rage, jealousy, and insecurity. They replace genuine human connections with parasocial relationships with influencers who don't know we exist. Children stay inside, isolated from real-world play and social development. Dating has been reduced to Tinder swipes, political discourse has become increasingly polarized, and even our art—our music, our television—has been transformed into optimization problems for viral success.

The current solutions feel inadequate. Yes, there's a resurgence in "dumb phones" and analog technologies. Schools are going "phone-free" and seeing promising results. But must we choose between embracing technology and preserving our agency? Are we doomed to repeat the pattern of the Luddites during the Industrial Revolution, or the fictional Butlerian Jihad of the Dune universe, where humans ultimately rejected intelligent machines entirely?

I believe there's a better way forward, and it lies in a technology that very few people are paying attention to: non-invasive neuromodulation. The rest of this essay is organized as follows. First, we will discuss the technology itself. Second, we will examine its applications and the current state of development. Then, we will consider the social implications of widespread adoption. Finally, we will discuss the risks to be managed.

## 2. Understanding Neuromodulation

Until recently, I thought brain-computer interfaces came in only two flavors: non-invasive interfaces that merely measure brain activity, and invasive interfaces like Neuralink that require surgical implantation. Given my background, neither of these really interested me — the former felt limited to clinical research and diagnosis, the latter limited to high-risk tolerant individuals with disabilities.

But there's a third category that changes everything: non-invasive neuromodulation. Put simply, these are systems that can modify our brain state without surgery. This capability is profound — akin to adding a sixth sense to our existing five, but one that's digitally native and programmable.

The technology comes in several forms:

- Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS): Uses precisely targeted sound waves to modulate specific brain regions
- Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): Applies weak electrical currents to influence neural activity
- Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS): Employs random electrical noise to enhance neural plasticity

Among these, tFUS stands out for its precision and potential. It can target areas as small as 1mm deep within the brain, without affecting surrounding tissue. Unlike optical approaches (limited by tissue penetration) or magnetic methods (which can't be miniaturized), ultrasound offers a unique combination of safety, precision, and scalability.

### 2.1 The Physics of tFUS

#### 2.1.1 Wave Interference

In classical mechanics, waves traveling over the same space will interfere with each other. Depending on their wavelengths and phases, they will either interfere constructively (resulting in a more energized wave) or destructively (resulting in a dampened wave).

#### 2.1.2 Beamforming

Ultrasound beamforming leverages wave interference to focus ultrasound waves with very high precision. At a calculated focal point, we will get constructive interference, and everywhere else, we will get destructive interference. Wave interference and beamforming is how tFUS is able to precisely target deep-brain regions without disrupting neighboring neurons.

#### 2.1.3 Putting it all together

Creating a tFUS headset requires multiple transducers spread out around the skull. These transducers can be programmed to jointly target a specific brain region to induce a desired change in brain state.

### 2.2 Programming tFUS Treatments

Now that we understand tFUS, how do we use it for neuromodulation? This question can be broken down into the following two questions. First, given a brain state and a desired outcome, how can we decide what region of the brain to stimulate over time? Second, how do we measure treatment success?

#### 2.2.1 Knowing what/when to stimulate

Knowing what to stimulate relies on prior knowledge of neuroscience, and functional imaging of the brain.

#### 2.2.2 Measuring Success

The efficacy of a treatment can be measured via objective biomarkers and subjective patient behavior/self-reporting.

## 3. The Current Landscape

### 3.1 Consumer Products

Commercialization of this technology is rapidly advancing. Various companies have already brought neuromodulation hardware (in the form of headsets and pendants) to market to monitor and or treat a specific neurological condition. Below is a non-comprehensive overview of the startups in the space.

- Flow Neuroscience uses tDCS to treat depression with fewer side effects than traditional SSRIs
- Muse and Bia Sleep focus on improving sleep quality through neural feedback
- Neurode Labs targets ADHD using tRNS
- Neurolief's FDA-approved Relivion system treats migraines
- Neurable tracks cognitive focus through non-invasive monitoring
- Multiple research groups are exploring creativity enhancement through various modulation techniques

Most interestingly, Nudge is working on a general-purpose tFUS neuromodulator that could be programmed for multiple applications.

### 3.2 Uncomercialized research

## 4. Societal Implications

The implications of widespread neuromodulation technology extend far beyond treating specific conditions. We're approaching a fundamental shift in how humans approach healthcare and consciousness.

## 4.1 A Revolution in Healthcare

Twenty-four-hour brain state monitoring combined with precise modulation could transform our approach to mental health. Instead of waiting for conditions to become severe enough for traditional intervention, we could maintain optimal mental health proactively.

**From Medicine 2.0 to Medicine 3.0**

As Dr. Peter Attia explains in his book outlive, our current healthcare system ‘Medicine 2.0’ focuses on treating acute diseases when they arise.

**Closed-loop, proactive modulation**

Imagine a system that combines a general purpose tFUS neuromodulator discussed above with a future generation of Meta-Rayban sunglasses. The AI-powered sunglasses could see and understand the world around you, and proactively send signals to your neuromodulator to prevent tempting but undesirable behavior. For example, if you were trying to cut sugar from your diet, and the glasses see cake, the AI could send a modulation request to your neuromodulator to temporarily increase focus or cut your appetite and cravings. This closed loop would be extremely powerful, but we may reject this design choice as it may re-introduce the problem of disenfranchisement from black-box algorithms.

## 4.2 An Artistic Renaissance

The programmable interplay between external stimuli (traditional art) and internal stimuli (from neuromodulation) will reignite creativity across all artistic mediums. Filmmakers, musicians, and other artists will be able to guide their audiences through precise emotional journeys. On a longer time horizon and with more advanced technology, we may see the emergence of pure "neuro-art" - compositions of mental states as an art form unto itself, created during bouts of intense focus and meditation.

## 4.3 Continuing Education and Upskilling

As our lifespans increase, maintaining neural plasticity becomes crucial. Neuromodulation could help prevent cognitive decline and ensure that longer lives remain intellectually vibrant. This has profound implications for everything from personal relationships to governance—imagine a world where age doesn't diminish one's ability to adapt to new technologies and ideas.

## 4.4 Self-Determination

Steve Jobs famously said that computers are like "bicycles for the mind", and many people on Twitter/X have said that AI is like an “e-bike for the mind’. In this framing, neuromodulation is the ability to pick the road we cycle on. It will enable us to harness our increasingly godlike digital technology while restoring our agency and humanity.

## 5. Risks, Challenges, and Considerations

As with any technology, there are many risks to consider.

- Trust and privacy
- Risk of becoming too fragile

## 6. Conclusion: The Right to Mental Self-Determination

Just as international law recognizes the right to self-determination—the ability of peoples to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development—perhaps it's time to recognize a right to mental self-determination.

In a world where our attention and emotions are increasingly manipulated by digital systems, the ability to maintain agency over our own mental states is not a luxury—it is a necessity. Non-invasive neuromodulation offers a path toward this future.
