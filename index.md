### About me

I am currently second-year MS computer science student at Columbia University, graduating in December 2024. This summer, I was a machine learning intern at [Tavus](https://tavus.io/developer), working on neural rendering of AI avatars.

I am interested in software that helps us better understand and/or actuate upon the physical world. Technically, this is a broad umbrella that covers robotics, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Socially, this covers many industries, including nutrition and health, sports and arts coaching, construction, biomanufacturing, and genetics.

Before returning to school:

- I was a software engineer at [Openstore](https://open.store/), on the growth and operations teams.
- I was an infrastructure software engineer at Salesforce on the [Hyperforce](https://www.salesforce.com/platform/public-cloud-infrastructure/) team.
- I graduated from the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), College of Engineering, with a computer science engineering degree and a minor in business from Michigan's Ross school of Business.
