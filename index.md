### About me

I am currently a second-year MS computer science student at Columbia University, graduating in December 2024. My program focus has been on machine learning, ranging from LLMs, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and ML systems (I was a teaching assistant for Columbia's ML systems course, _High Performance Machine Learning_). Over the summer, I was a machine learning intern at [Tavus](https://tavus.io/), working on neural rendering of AI avatars.

Outside of my ML focus, I have also completed coursework/research in computational biology, robotics, and quantum computing. This was driven by my interest in software that helps us better understand and/or actuate on the physical world, from health to materials to manufacturing.

Before returning to school, I was a software engineer for several years:

- I was a software engineer at [Openstore](https://open.store/), on the growth and operations teams.
- I was an infrastructure software engineer at Salesforce on the [Hyperforce](https://www.salesforce.com/platform/public-cloud-infrastructure/) team.
- I graduated from the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), College of Engineering, with a computer science engineering degree and a minor in business from Michigan's Ross school of Business.
